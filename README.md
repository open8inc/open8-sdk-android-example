# Open8 Android SDK
This is an example app to demonstrate how a developer can leverage our ad network to monetize their app. Integration documentation are available on [wiki](https://github.com/open8inc/open8-sdk-android-example/wiki/In-Feed-Wide-Fit-Panel-Ad-Integration-example).

The SDK is currently in beta stage. Only Infeed video ads are supported at the moment.
